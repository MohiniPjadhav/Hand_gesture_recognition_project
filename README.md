Introduction
Hand gesture recognition is a significant field in computer vision that aims to interpret human hand movements using machine learning algorithms. This project leverages TensorFlow for model training and OpenCV for real-time video processing.

Features
Real-time hand gesture recognition
Customizable gesture classes
Easy to train on new gestures
Uses TensorFlow for deep learning
Utilizes OpenCV for image processing
Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
NumPy

Steps
Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-recognition.git
cd hand-gesture-recognition
Create a virtual environment:

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset (if applicable) and place it in the appropriate directory.

Usage
To run the hand gesture recognition application, use the following command:

sh
Copy code
python hand_gesture_recognition.py
This will start the application and open a window displaying the video feed with real-time hand gesture recognition.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of hand gesture images. You can use publicly available datasets or create your own dataset by capturing images of different hand gestures.

Model Training
To train the model, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset and organize it into training and validation sets.
Modify the train_model.py script to point to your dataset directory.
Run the training script:
sh
Copy code
python train_model.py
This will train the model and save the trained model weights to a file.

Results
Include some sample images or a video demonstrating the hand gesture recognition performance. You can also include a description of the model's accuracy and any challenges faced during development.
